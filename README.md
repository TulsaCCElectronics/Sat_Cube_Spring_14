Sat_Cube_Spring_14
==================

This code was used in a datalogger for a high altitude balloon launch. All features worked well. 
The devices used were 3.3v 8MHz 328p, mpl3115a2, sd card, and mma8452q accelerometer. 

Here is an image of launch data. It is inside a sealed enclosure and was measuring changes for 
biological experiments. http://i.imgur.com/SRyneaa.png
